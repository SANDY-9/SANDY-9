# I'm SANDY.


<br>I'm currently **Android Developer.**<br>
My main tech stack is android. So, I'm good at **Kotlin** and **Java**. <br>
In addition, I have knowledge of Python, JavaScript, HTML, Java Spring and SQL.


Iâ€™m currently studying to improve my skills.
I'm interested in how to make apps better and more stable. 


<br>I like and seek to readable code. To do so, I'm always thinking and studying.<br>
I want to develop **clean code!**, to be a **good** developer.<br><br>
